* `v0.6`, in progress

    Allow for defining Dask Client subclasses, such as SSHCluster or SlurmCluster.

    Re-organized how Dask distributed configuration is handled in YAML files.

    The `bygen` algorithm, which is a traditional by-generational evolutionary
    algorithm, now supports distributed evaluations.

    Broke out how YAML configuration files are handled into a separate module.

* `v0.5`, 1/27/23

    Installed executable now `gremlin` instead of `gremlin.py`.  Compensated
    for LEAP API changes. (Note that `gremlin` still depends on the LEAP
    `develop` branch and not on the official LEAP `master` branch releases to
    take advantage of more up to date LEAP features.)

    Added optional `with_client` `async` config section for code to be executed
    after Dask client is started.  This can be used to start worker plugins or
    wait for a certain number of workers to become available.

    `setup.py` now installs third party dependencies.  Please note that the
    latest LEAP version in LEAP `develop` will have to be installed.

    Now better catch exceptions in LEAP code such that any errors that
    propagate from there don't silently kill Gremlin.

    Made a number of minor bug fixes and code format changes.

* `v0.4`, 9/30/22

    Replaced `imports` with `preamble` in YAML config files thus giving more
    flexibility for importing dependencies, but also allows for defining
    functions and variables that may be referred to in, say, the pipeline.

    Added optional `with_client` text block for `async` Gremlin whereby one can
    put in optional code to be executed after Dask client has been connected.
    This allows for things like `client.wait_for_workers()` and
    `client.upload_file()` calls to be added to Gremlin runs.

* `v0.3`, 3/9/22

    Add support for config variable `algorithm` that denotes if using a
    traditional by-generation EA or an asynchronous steady-state EA

* `v0.2dev`, 2/17/22

    Revamped config system and heavily refactored/simplified code

* Version `0.1dev` Migrated to github, 10/14/2021

    This version moved from code.ornl.gov repository to github to facilitate
    use as an open-source project.

* Version `0.0` Migrated from internal repository, 7/13/2021

    Migrated from internal git repository to code.ornl.gov, and generalized
    source to be more readily applicable to new problems.
