* `v0.4`, in progress

    Replaced `imports` with `preamble` in YAML config files thus giving more
    flexibility for importing dependencies, but also allows for defining
    functions and variables that may be referred to in, say, the pipeline.

    Added optional `with_client` text block for `async` Gremlin whereby one can
    put in optional code to be executed after Dask client has been connected.
    This allows for things like `client.wait_for_workers()` and
    `client.upload_file()` calls to be added to Gremlin runs.

* `v0.3`, 3/9/22

  Add support for config variable `algorithm` that denotes if using a
  traditional by-generation EA or an asynchronous steady-state EA

* `v0.2dev`, 2/17/22

  Revamped config system and heavily refactored/simplified code

* Version `0.1dev` Migrated to github, 10/14/2021

  This version moved from code.ornl.gov repository to github to facilitate
  use as an open-source project.

* Version `0.0` Migrated from internal repository, 7/13/2021

  Migrated from internal git repository to code.ornl.gov, and generalized
  source to be more readily applicable to new problems.
